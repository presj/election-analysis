Written Analysis of the Election Audit
Overview of Election Audit

This challenge involved assisting a board of elections employee with auditing the election results of a congressional district.  
My goal was to use Python to create a script that would automate the task of analyzing the collected data.  
Further, a successful outcome could mean use of the same code in other election audits.  
After reviewing the dataset in the election data csv file, I provided the following:  

Election-Audit Results

Total number of votes cast in this election: 

369,711

Number and percentage of votes for each county: 

Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)

County with the largest number of votes:

Denver County

Number and percentage of votes for each candidate: 

Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

Winner of electionâ€™s vote count and percentage of total vote:

Diana DeGette received 272, 892 votes and won the election with 73.8% of the total vote.

Election-Audit Summary

The election results were compiled from work performed in module three and the challenge.  
While the numbers were correct and will prove useful, this task required some additional work to organize the data.  
The initial script that was created produced the wrong county as having the largest number of votes.  
The issue was in the printing instruction commands. The updates to the program are minor and will prove effective for future election audits,
including application in other jurisdictions.  One way the existing program might be improved on is by running creating code that will 
keep pace with the real-time count of election returns as they are tabulated.
